# E-Commerce Product Tracking

- Created a Java program to keep track of all products for an E-Commerce Company using NetBeans.
- Implemented a linked list to store product information including product id, product name and supplier name and allow users to perform any operation on the menu to insert, delete, or retrieve record for the product.
